This README briefly describes how to bootstrap the Earthdata Download project. For more information about Earthdata Download, check out the `/docs` directory.

## Development

Ensure you are using the NodeJS version defined in `.nvmrc`

To install dependencies:

    npm install

In order to run the project locally you need to run:

    npm start

To run the Jest tests:

    npm test

To run the Playwright tests:

    npm run playwright

To build the jsdoc documentation:

    npm run docs

    # Outputs documentation in the `docs/jsdoc` directory

## Building

To build the installers run one of the following, matching your operating system:

    npm run dist:mac
    npm run dist:win
    npm run dist:linux

## Create a Release

To create a new release, first ensure you bump the `version` in [package.json](package.json) and run `npm install` as part of your pull request.

After your PR has been merged, create a new tag that matches your package.json `version`, prepended by the letter `v`

    git tag -a "v1.4.2" -m "v1.4.2 Release"

And push that tag to GitHub

    git push --tags

That will trigger the Build/Release workflow, and create a new draft release matching your `version`.
